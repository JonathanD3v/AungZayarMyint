Hi there! 👋 I’m Aung Zayar Myint, but you can call me Jonathan. 😄


  👀   I’m passionate about learning new web technologies, with a current focus on the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
  
  🌱   I’m constantly working on improving my skills to build robust and scalable applications.
  
  💬   Feel free to ask me anything about the MERN Stack—I love discussing backend architecture, frontend development, and database management!
