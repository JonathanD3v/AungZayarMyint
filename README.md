Hi there! 👋 I’m Aung Zayar Myint, but you can call me Jonathan. 😄

👀 I’m super passionate about web development and always excited to build cool stuff.

🌱 Currently diving deep into the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and loving every bit of it!

📫 You can reach me at aungzayar1352000@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn—let’s chat!

⚡ Fun fact: I’m that person who will happily trade sleep for a good coding session. 🖥️💡

Let’s create something awesome together!
